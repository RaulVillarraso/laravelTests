# laravelTests

This is  a test to practice a little of Laravel. 
In this project we are able to see a list a classes with a build and the role they represent in an fictional RPG. It's designed to work on localhost and with a database called "laravel_test". 
- In the route "/" we should be able to see the list of all classes in the database along with their builds and roles.
- In the route "/form" we should be able to see a formulary to create more builds. In this case is only to show off in the list.
